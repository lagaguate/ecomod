# **[dropdowns.r](../src/_RFunctions/dropdowns.r)**
#### MMM - Jan 2016 
This file contains a number of functions that facilitate getting lists of unique values from observer tables for use in things like select lists.  So far, it only has 
*    get.species and 
*    get.gear
but adding additional ones are trivial.
