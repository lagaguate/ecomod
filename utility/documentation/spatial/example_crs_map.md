This makes a basemap using number of packages.

![Example of example_crs_map.R (with bathymetry)](images/example_crs_map.png)

This script makes a nice looking, publication quality map.  It handles projections nicely, and with the exception of bathymetry data, requires no local data.

It is not written as a function, and I'm not sure if that would be useful.
