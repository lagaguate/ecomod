  # NOTE to all: The year of "current.assessment.year must be changed every year before any other run
  # It cannot be automatically loaded together with the "load.snowcrab.environment". This is because 
  # running in parallel mode requires overrding some parameters in "p" on occasion which cannot be done 
  # ("load.snowcrab.environment" is sourced with every initialisation of a new CPU).
  # Copying the following into each relevent file is not a solution as it is error prone and  repetitive.
