\section{Fishery}
The Snow Crab fishery in eastern Canada began in 1960 with incidental bycatches by groundfish draggers near Gaspe, Quebec. Its development was slow until the 1980s, when it began expanding rapidly to become one of the largest fisheries in Canada in terms of landings and landed value. On the Scotian Shelf, the fishery has been in existence since the early 1970s. The Scotian Shelf Snow Crab fishery lands only males with carapace width greater than or equal to 95 mm. There is also a concerted effort to avoid areas of newly moulted (soft shelled) crab and to discard immature males. Total landings increased to record levels of approximately 10 000 t each year in the early 2000s and have surpassed these previous highs since 2009 (Figure 1). Landings in 2015 for N-ENS and S-ENS were 619 t and 11292 t, respectively, which represent a 20\% drop in landings for N-ENS, however this closely follows the total allowable catches (TACs) for each region. Landings in 4x for the 2014/2015 season were 91 t, as of February 25, 2016, which already represents a 10\% increase over the 2014/2015 season, however the total allowable catch in this area was increased by 85\%. Total allowable catches in 2015 were 624 t, 11311 t, and 150 t for N-ENS, S-ENS and 4x, respectively (Figure 2, Tables 1-3). \\

In S-ENS, the spatial distribution of landings in 2015 (Figure 3) were similar to 2014 with a few exceptions; a reduction inshore, northeast of Sable Island (in CFA 24) and northwest of Banquereau Bank (CFA 23). In N-ENS in 2015, landings were focused on the inner area and the Glace Bay Hole (Figure 3). There was little change in the spatial distribution of landings in 4x. \\

Non-standardized catch rates in 2015 (Figure 4) were 103 kg/trap haul in N-ENS, 106 kg/trap haul in S-ENS, and 35 kg/trap haul in 4x in 2015/2015 (34 kg/trap haul in 4x in 2014/2015 - which relative to the previous year represents a decrease of 4\% N-ENS, decrease of 6\% S-ENS, and a 130\% increase in 4x (Tables 1-3, Figures 3-4). The spatial distribution of catch rates were similar to 2014, with decreases inshore, northest of Sable Island, northwest of Banquereau Bank in S-ENS (Figure 6)

%----------catch composition------------------------------------------------
\section{Commercial Catch Composition}
There has been a shift towards larger animals in N-ENS catches in the past four years, suggesting higher survival of immature crab (lack of handling mortality of soft-shelled crab), whereas S-ENS has shown a more stable mean crab size in the catches (Figure 7). Crab caught in 4X showed an increase in mean size after two straight years of decreases. Larger mean size of animals caught (with associated heavier mean animal weight) reduces the number of animals required to catch the TAC within an area.\\

Carapace condition (CC) defines the approximate age (since terminal moult) of the crab based on the relative development and subsequent decay of the carapace. CC1 signifies a newly moulted crab, soft-shelled, with no epibiont growth. The oldest carapace condition CC5 signifies extensive shell decay where there is no expectation of survival into the next year. Carapace conditions of commercial catches are subjectively determined by at-sea fisheries observers and can be affected by individual assessment of CC, time of year, etc.  Less CC2 and more CC3 crab were observed in the catch in 2015, as compared to 2014, in both N-ENS and S-ENS (Figures 8 \& 9). 4X catches showed a reduction in CC2 and CC3 with an associated increase in CC4 (Figure 9). No appreciable amount of CC5 crab are observed in any area.\\

The spring season (2008 -present) was adopted to reduce fishing intensity in the summer season and also to encourage fishing during the earlier period when newly molted crab are too weak and soft to easily enter into traps. Since 2010, the majority of landings ($\geq$ 60\%) from N- and S-ENS were caught during the spring season. Spring landings in 2015 decreased siginifcantly in both areas, particularly in N-ENS (21\%), due to spring ice conditions. The capture of soft-shelled crab (<68 on durometer, a hardness guage) represented less than 5\% of catches in all commercial areas in 2015.\\

\section{Assessment}

\subsection{Fishable Biomass Index}
The fishable biomass (Figures 11-13) is defined as the segment of the Snow Crab biomass that is male, mature, larger than 95 mm CW and hard-shelled (with a durometer measure of 68 or greater). This year, the fishable biomass index is presented as the geometric mean of fishable biomass measured from the Snow Crab trawl survey.\\

In N-ENS, the post-fishery fishable biomass index of Snow Crab in 2015 was 0.19 t\textbackslash$km^2$, relative to 0.35 t\textbackslash$km^2$ in 2014, representing a 45\% decrease. This decreasing trend has been observed for the past four years. The geometric mean fishable biomass is slightly below the long-term average. In N-ENS declines in fishable biomass were evenly spatial distributed. An increase fishable biomass was found in only three tows in the Western Glace Bay Hole area (Figures 11-12).\\

In S-ENS, the post-fishery fishable biomass index of Snow Crab in 2015 was 0.45 t\textbackslash$km^2$, relative to 0.70 t\textbackslash$km^2$ in 2014, representing a 36\% decrease. The fishable biomass index is at the long-term average of 0.47 t\textbackslash$km^2$. The Scotian Slope, and upstream areas of the Gully experienced the largest changes in fishable biomass from 2014 (Figure 11).\\

In 4x, the pre-fishery fishable biomass index was 0.05 t\textbackslash$km^2$, relative to 0.12 t\textbackslash$km^2$ in 2014, representing a 58\% decrease. The 2014 biomass estimate in 4x was highly uncertain as only a subset of survey stations were completed in 2014. The spatial distribution of fishable biomass in 4x was patchy, with little or no change in fishable biomass in the majority of tows that surveyed in both 2014 and 2015.\\

\subsection{Recruitment}
 Based on size-frequency histograms of the male snow crab population, very limited internal recruitment to the fishery is expected (similar to 2014) in N-ENS and 4x (Figure 14). In N-ENS, there a gap persists between 75 and 95 mm carapace width, which will likely maintain depressed recruitment levels for the next 2-3 years without immigration of crab from adjacent crab fishing areas. Area 4x also shows minimal potential for internal recruitment to the fishery for the *foreseeable future*. Movement is potentially an important source of crab entering the fishery in 4X and a lack of any commercial fishing effort on the western portion of CFA 24 potentially benefits 4x. Immigration of crab from outside a given area can represent recruitment to the fishery but can be unreliable and difficult to estimate,  based on its episodic nature. Information obtained through movement studies may help better define immigration / emmigration patterns. \\

In S-ENS, internal recruitment is expected to remain at moderate/ consistent levels. The presence of small immature male snow crab spanning almost all size ranges in S-ENS (20-95 mm CW) observed by the survey suggests that recruitment to the fishery is probable for the next four to five years and beyond.

\subsection{Reproduction}

Sex ratios (proportion female) continued to be male dominated in N-ENS and S-ENS. When the relative number of mature females is high, the possibility of reproductive limitation is present, where there is an absence of large mature males able to mate and protect more rapidly maturing and smaller females. Mature female abundance has increased slightly in N-ENS, likely caused by the earliest maturing animals of a recruitment pulse propogating through the system in all areas since first being observed in 2010. Sex ratios are at low, but stable levels in S-ENS (Figure 15), however There is a a spatial divide between mature females and mature males in S-ENS. In 4x mature female abundance continues to be at moderate levels, with a slight increase from 2014.\\

 Based on size frequency histograms, newly matured female crab are expected in all areas for the next 3-4 years. Female Snow Crab of a given year-class will mature 2 to 4 years earlier than a male from the same year-class, *therefore we should be expecting the pulse of male grab to propagate through the system in 2-4 years.* Each newly matured female should support egg production for 3-5 years. \\

\subsection{Fishing Mortality}

In N-ENS, Fishing Mortality (F) has been estimated to have been in the range of 0.1 to 0.9, peaking in 2004 (Figure 17). In 2015, fishing mortality is estimated to have been 0.35 and has been increasing over the past several years. A reduction in fishing mortality in 2008 was implemented to reduce soft shell handling.\\

Estimated fishing mortality for S-ENS has historically ranged from 0.05 to 0.25, peaking in 2003/2004 (Figure 17). In 2015, fishing mortality was estimated to have been 0.24. Localized exploitation rates are likely higher, as not all areas where biomass estimates are provided are fished (e.g. continental slope areas and western, inshore areas of CFA24).\\

In 4x, estimated fishing mortality has historically ranged from 0.2 to > 0.4, peaking in 2005 and 2011/2012 (Figure 17). In 2014/2015, estimated fishing mortality was 0.042. Realized exploitation rates are likely to be higher, since the computed exploitation rates incorporate biomass from throughout the 4x area and not just the fishery grounds.

\subsection{Temperature}
%Make a comment about the lower temperatures in snow crab area, vs. the higher temperatures on the Scotian Shelf in general
Average bottom temperatures measured during the Snow Crab survey in 2015 were slightly lower in all areas, in comparison to 2014 (Figure 19). This is in contrast to a general warming trend observed since the early-1990s. The bottom temperatures decreased in 4x in the past three years, after the extreme warm water event of 2012, though it still remains at the long-term mean for the area. In S-ENS, and N-ENS temperatures decreased close to the long-term mean for the areas. Changing temperatures will have an impact on available Snow Crab habitat into the future. 

%The surface area of potential Snow Crab habitat in the SSE was calculated as the arithmetic mean of the potential habitat area estimated in the previous five years (Figure **).

\subsection{Bottom-up (Resource Limitation)}

Food items such as Northern Shrimp are found in concentrations comparable to the long-term average in most core areas of S-ENS (based on the Snow Crab trawl survey; Figure 20).

\subsection{Top-down (Predation)}
%Put a comment about cod increasing in this section.
The capacity of predatory groundfish to opportunistically feed upon Snow Crab, in combination with their numerical dominance prior to the 1990s, suggests that they may have been an important regulating factor controlling the recruitment of Snow Crab. The demise of these predatory groundfish in the post-1990 period, and the resultant release from predation upon the immature and soft-shelled crabs, may have been an important determinant of the current rise to dominance of Snow Crab in the SSE. Based on stomach sampling, Atlantic Halibut, Atlantic Wolfish and skate species appear to be the predominant predators of Snow Crab, though it does not appear to represent more than 2.2\% of their diet on the Scotian Shelf. Of these species, Halibut and Cod biomass have been increasing in the Snow Crab survey. Halibut biomass has increased since 2012, except in N-ENS where it decreased in 2015, however it is still above the long term mean (Figure 21). Cod biomass has been variable, but has increased in N-ENS for the past 4 years, and has been above the 20-year mean in S-ENS for the past 7 years. Thorny skate biomass has increased in S-ENS for the past three years and is well above the long-term mean.\\   

Seals are considered by some fishers to be a predator of Snow Crab, and their continued increase in abundance is a source of concern for some fishers and scientists. While seals have been observed with Snow Crab in their stomachs, it should be emphasized that high concentrations of Snow Crab are found in the immediate vicinity of Sable Island, an area where the abundance of Grey Seals is extremely high. There is little evidence suggesting that seals have an overall negative influence on the Snow Crab population. Seal predation of groundfish could also lower potential lateral competition for Snow Crab food resources. 

\subsection{Lateral (Competition)}

Large mature males stabilize the Snow Crab population by maintaining and occupying prime crab habitat. Large mature males keep potential competitors (other crab species and groundfish) at bay. They also serve as strong mates for the current population of mature females, and are protectors of smaller females. Their over-exploitation can have various negative biological consequences. An important consequence of the extended period of low numbers of females to males (Figure 22) is that poor egg and larval production area likely now occurring. Stabilization of such strong oscillations in abundance into the future may be possible if reproduction of the currently available females is supported by an adequate population of large males. 

The diet of Snow Crab overlap in many ways with that of some groundfish species; thus, the demise of these groundfish groups in the late-1980s and early-1990s would have been doubly beneficial to Snow Crab through the reduction in both predation pressure and resource competition.

\section{Conclusions and Advice}
\subsection{Precautionary Approach}
Many exisiting measures and fishing practices of the Scotian Shelf Snow Crab fishery are inherently precautionary and should be reiterated:
\begin{itemize}
  \item The prompt and careful return of immature (small-class, non-terminally moulted) crab to the water is an important conservation measure that will enhance the mid-term (2-3 year) sustainability of this fishery. This is a measure that needs to continue.
  \item No removal of female crab. Reproductive potential of spawning stock biomass is not distrupted. Most remmovals of males occur after mating and sub-legal mature crab (able to reporduce are never removed).
  \item Conservative exploitation strategies have generally been the norm, especially in recent years. 
  \item Refugia from directed fishing pressures exist in the Gully MPA, along the continental slope, and much of the western inshore portion of CFA 24.\
  \item Immature and soft-shelled (newly-moulted, easily damaged) crab are not harvested and handling mortality is minimized via area closures, low economic value, education, at-sea observer monitoring of soft-shell incidence has helped to maximize the potential yield per animal to the biomass. \\
 \end{itemize} 

Harvest Control Rules (HCR) have been developed which link the biomass reference points to the exploitation reference points (Figure 22). In the Cautious and Healthy zones, actual target harvest rates are shaped by a suite of secondary indicators that provide more complete information on the entire stock's health. The secondary indicators are used to inform management decision under the HCR linking the stock references to harvest strategies. Secondary indicators include expected recruitment, spawning stock biomass, size and age structureof various stock components, sex ratios, environmental variables, fishery performance and others. If a stock is determined to be in the Critical Zone, all fishing activities cease with the belief that this will allow the stock to rebuild. \\

The operational reference points associated with the 4VWX Snow Crab fishery are as follows: 
\begin{itemize}
  \item Lower Stock Reference (LSR): 25\% of carrying capacity\
  \item Upper Stock Reference (USR): 50\% of carrying capacity\
  \item Removal Reference (RR): not to exceed FMSY(where F is the fishing mortality of the legal sized mature male population and MSY is the theoretical Maximum Sustainable Yield)\
  \item Target Removal Reference (TRR): 20\% of the bishable biomass (F=0.22). Secondary, contextual indicators are used to alter harvest rates between 10 and 30\% of fishable biomass (FB; F=0.11 to F=0.36)
\end{itemize}

The Harvest Control Rules are, therefore, as follows:\
\begin{itemize}
  \item FB > USR: target exploitation rate of 10\% - 30\% be utilized, based upon contextual information provided by secondary indicators\
  \item LSR < FB < USR: target exploitation rate of 0\% - 20\%, based upon contextual information provided by secondary indicators\
  \item FB < LSR: fishery closure until recovery (at a minimum, until FB > LSR)\\
\end{itemize}
\clearpage

From the logistic model output, the current estimates of carrying capacity for the fishable biomass of snow crab are estimated to be (and 95\% CI):\
\begin{itemize}
  \item N-ENS: 5.99 (*) kt\
  \item S-ENS: 75.55 (*) kt\
  \item 4x: 2.11 (*) kt\\
\end{itemize}

The estimates of FMSY (and 95\% CI) were:\
\begin{itemize}
  \item N-ENS: 0.454 (*)\
  \item S-ENS: 0.441 (*)\
  \item 4x: 0.482 (*)\\
\end{itemize}

Estimates for 4x should be considered highly uncertain, due to the brevity of their data series and uncertain nature of their distributions.

\section{Conclusions}
A reference points-based Precautionary Approach (PA) has been implemented in this fishery. The Limit Reference Point (LRP) is 25\% of carrying capactiy and the Upper Stock Reference (USR) is 50\% of carrying capacity. The target removal reference is 20\% of the fishable biomass in each area and the Removal Reference is not to exceed FMSY. Various secondary (population and ecosystem) indicators are taken into consideration for management decisions. 

\subsection{N-ENS}
In N-ENS the fishable biomass has decreased over the past four years, and pushed the stock into the "cautious" zone (LSR < FB < USR; Figure 22). 
 Depressed recruitment into the fishery is expected for the next 2-3 years, without immigration of crab from adjacent fishing areas. However newly mature female crab are expected in N-ENS for the next 3-4 years and sex ratios are recovering from near zero. Movement is potentially an important souce of crab in this area, but is unreliable and difficult to estimate, based on its episodic nature. A decreased harvest strategy is recommended. Based on the biomass trends obtained during the survey and recruitment patterns a decreased TAC is recommended. 

\subsection{S-ENS}
In S-ENS the population is considered to be in the "healthy" zone (FB > USR; Figure 22). There was, however, a large decrease in fishable biomass (35\%). Fishable biomass appeared to be retracted to primary habitat due to warmer temperatures on the banks and potentially inshore. The spatial distribution of higher landings and CPUE also decreased. Increasing temperatures are expected to have long-term effects decreasing the available Snow Crab habitat. \\

Despite long-term habitat concerns, the population is still high compared to historic levels and recruitment into the fishery is stable. The proportion of females is also low but stable. Females are expected to age to maturity over the next 2-3 years in S-ENS. Fishing mortality is currently slightly above the 20\% exploitation rate, but not approaching FMSY. Biomass of predators has been increasing over time, potentially has long-term effects on the biomass. A marginal decrease in TAC is recommended. 


\subsection{4x}
Area 4x is the southern-most area of Snow Crab distribution, existing in more "marginal" environments relative to the "prime" areas of S- and N-ENS, an explicityly PA towards the fishery is essential in this area. Further, the lower recruitment into the fishable biomass and the large inter-annual temperature variations (especially in 2012) increases the uncertainty associated with this area. The 2012/2013 fishery landed approximately 45\% of TAC, which resulted in a decrease in TAC for 2013/2014 to 80 t. In the past, S-ENS has been assumed to provide a buffer for 4x via immigration as evidenced by a large portion of 4x's commercial biomass being proximal to the S-ENS line. In 2014, the biomass moved from the "cautious" zone to the "healthy" zone, however there was considerable uncertainty ini the biomass estimate as the westernmost portion of the survey stations in 4x were not completed. Indeed, there was a large decline in the fishable biomass index in the 2015/2016 season, relative to the highly uncertain index last year. However, there was little or no change in fishable biomass in the majority of tows that were surveyed in both 2014 and 2015. Recruitment patterns show minimal recruitment is expected into the fishery over the next 2-3 years. Potential predators are increasing as halibut biomass has increased in 2015 in 4x. Based on the fishable biomass of survey stations that were surveyed in both 2014 and 2015, and expected recruitment a status-quo to marginal decrease in TAC is recommended pending further analysis prior to the 2015-2016 season.
